# Overview {#concept_lf1_crl_zdb .concept}

If you use a server in mainland China to host your website, you must complete ICP Filing.

If you want to host your website on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance in any mainland China regions, you must apply for an ICP Filling through the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/) \(only available in Chinese\) according to the  [ICP Filing regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) of the province  where your business is registered. After your application is approved, you can configure your domain name resolution to direct your domain name to your Alibaba Cloud ECS instance.

You can carry out the following filing operations on the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/)  \(only available in Chinese\):

-   [First ICP Filing](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/ICP Filing for the first time.md#)

    Neither the license or certificate of the organization or individual \(that is, the subject of the ICP Filing\), nor the website domain name which directs to a mainland China Alibaba Cloud ECS instance, has been filed with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\). In this case, you must complete ICP Filing through the Alibaba Cloud Filing system.

-   [Transfer an ICP Filing](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud and cancel an transfer.md#) \(transfers an existing ICP Filing license to Alibaba Cloud\)

    If your domain name has already been filed through another service provider, and now you want to host your website on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance in a mainland China region, you must transfer the ICP Filing to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. The transfer-in procedures for new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system users are slightly different from the transfer-in procedures for Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system users who have ever filed through the Alibaba Cloud system.

-   [Add a new website for ICP Filing \(for new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system users\)](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Add new websites for ICP Filing (New Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users).md#)

    The license or certificate of the organization or individual \(that is, the subject of the ICP Filing\) has been filed with the MIIT through another service provider. However, a new website is hosted on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance in a mainland China region, so you must file your new website domain names with the MIIT through Alibaba Cloud.

-   [Add a new website for ICP Filing \(the previous filings are on Alibaba Cloud system\)](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Add new websites for ICP Filing ( Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users).md#)

    The license or certificate of the organization or individual \(that is, the subject of the ICP Filing\) has been filed with MIIT through Alibaba Cloud, and you want to host a new website on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance in a mainland China region.

-   [ICP Filing information change](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#)

    If you have completed an ICP Filing through the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, and want to edit the information of the filing subject \(such as the name or license number of the organization\) or the website \(such as adding or removing a domain name\),  you can change the information on the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

-   [Claim an ICP Filing](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/[Claim an ICP Filing].md#)

    You have successfully filed for ICP record with HiChina before June 2010, and the ICP Filing has never been transferred to other service providers or the  new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. Now, you must claim the ICP Filing.

-   [Cancel an ICP Filing](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Cancel an ICP Filing.md#)

    If you do not use your website filed through Alibaba Cloud, you must cancel the filing \(of the subject/website\) or cancel the ICP Filing transfer. If you want to cancel one of the multiple domain names bound to a website, delete this domain name by modifying the website information instead of canceling the ICP Filing of the website.


You apply for the [Public Security Bureau \(PSB\) Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/PSB Filing FAQs.md#) and [ICP Commercial License](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/ICP Commercial License filing links.md#) from the relevant authorities.

-   PSB Filing: According to the “Protection and Management Regulations for Computer Information Network and Internet Security”, within 30 days after opening a website, a PSB Filing application must be submitted through the [Security Management Service Platform of the National Public Security Authorities Website](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index).

-   ICP Commercial License: An online sales platform or third-party sales website for products or services must be with a business license from the local industrial and commercial administration, and an ICP Commercial License from the local communications administration. Contact your local authorities for the list of required documents and the filing procedure that you must follow. Go to the MIIT filing management system \(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\) for information about provincial administrations.
