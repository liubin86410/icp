# ICP Filing for the first time {#concept_ghz_3rl_zdb .concept}

If your website domain name has not been ICP filed with the MIIT, and you use an Alibaba Cloud server to host the website, you must apply for an ICP Filing license for the domain name through Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system \(only available in Chinese\).

**Note:** In accordance with the official application process, the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system is only available in Chinese. Therefore, you must complete the application in Chinese. You must pay attention to the ICP Filing rules of the MIIT. For personal website, you must read [Personal website naming requirements](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/Subject and website information FAQs.md#section_rdk_mvr_zdb).

## Prerequisites {#section_cd2_xyy_zdb .section}

-   Read the local [ICP Filing regulations](https://icpbeian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) carefully. If you want to know more about MIIT requirements, visit the [MIIT website](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/).
-   Purchase an ECS instance with a subscription for at least three months and with an Internet IP.

-   You must register your domain name from a China-based domain name provider \(for example, aliyun.com\).  Alibaba Cloud International is an international service provider, so domain names registered from Alibaba Cloud International \(alibabacloud.com\) are not supported by the MIIT ICP Filing system. We recommend that you register the domain name for ICP Filing from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\).

    The domain name verification is successful only when the following criteria are met:

    -   The domain name provider must receive an approved certificate from the MIIT.
    -   The top-level domain name must be approved by the MIIT.
    -   The domain name must be in its validity period.
    -   The domain name has passed the real-name authentication. The ICP Filing subject information must be consistent with the domain name registrant \(domain name holder\) information.
-   Keep scanned copies or photos of your identifications and other required documents handy.
    -   Individuals must provide scanned copies or photos of the front and back of ID cards.
    -   Organizations must provide scanned copies or photos of the registration certificates, pictures of the front and back of the ID cards of the persons in charge of ICP Filing and the websites, and an authentication document duly stamped with the official seal of the company.
-   Prepare a website ICP Filing authenticity statement. You must download the template of ICP Filing authenticity statement from the Document Uploading page of ICP Filing system.

    **Note:** Some local administrations have special requirements for the ICP Filing authenticity statement, so we do not recommend that you download the template from other sources.

-   Prepare other documents required by the local administrations. For example, domain name certificates and residence permits.

    After you submit your information and documents, Alibaba Cloud reviews your information and documents in one business day. Make sure that your phone number is in service and the call is answered during the normal working hours in China. If we find any problem , we contact you by the phone number in your ICP Filing information.

6.  After your information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) to upload a picture of the website administrator as required for verification.

    **Note for Shanghai users: ** Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai **must** use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator.  For more information, see [Using Shanghai communications administration app to verify the website administrator](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

    For other regions, ICP applicants can select one of several designated places, which are scattered in most major cities in China, to take an official photo and upload the picture for verification as part of the application process. This rule demands the applicants to physically present in China long enough to have a picture taken. However, Alibaba Cloud can make it easier. You can apply for an official background \(that is, photo backdrop\) from the document uploading page of your ICP Filing process. Click **Enter Your Address**, and enter an address in mainland China. Alibaba Cloud can mail the photo backdrop to any region in mainland China. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. \(Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.\)

    For more information, see [Website administrator verification FAQs](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/Website administrator verification FAQs.md#section_tb4_cht_zdb).

    After receiving eligible pictures and approving your application, Alibaba Cloud submits the application to the local communications administration for approval. You are notified by an email and a text message.

7.  Verify the mobile phone number of the subject and website administrators.  Currently, mobile phone verification is required by the local authorities of Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Other provinces do not require mobile phone number verification.

    If you apply for ICP Filing in the seven regions, you will receive a text message \(in Chinese\) from the MIIT in five minutes after you get a message and email from Alibaba Cloud.

    **You must follow the message to verify your mobile phone number within 48 hours.  If you have not finish the verification in 48 hours, your ICP Filing application will be rejected**.
