## Why does my website domain name fail the domain name verification? {#section_hq2_xls_zdb .section}

If a domain name does not pass the verification, possible reasons are as follows:

-   The top-level domain name may not be approved by the MIIT.

    Solution: Contact your domain name registrar to confirm the situation. You must use a domain name approved by the MIIT for ICP Filing.

-   Your domain name registrar may not be approved by the MIIT.

    Solution: Contact your domain name registrar for solution. you must transfer your domain name to a registrar approved by the MIIT.

-   The validity period of your domain name has expired.

    Solution: Contact your domain name registrar to confirm the situation and renew your registration.

-   You have not completed real-name authentication for your domain name.

    Solution: Complete domain name real-name authentication,  and the information must be consistent with the information of the ICP Filing subject.

-   You have completed real-name authentication for your domain name, but it has not been recorded in the MIIT system.

    Solution: It takes about two business days for the MIIT system to record the real-name authentication information. Resubmit the ICP Filing application after you confirm that your domain name information has been recorded in the MIIT system.

-   Your ICP Filing subject information is not consistent with the domain name real-name information.

    Solution: Change the information. You can modify the information of the domain name holder or the information of the subject.

## My domain name is not registered with my own information. What can I do? {#section_oq2_xls_zdb .section}

During ICP Filing, the communications administration verifies that the domain name holder information matches the information of the ICP Filing subject or the subject administrator. If the holder of your domain name is not you or your company, you must change the domain name holder information on the website of your domain name service provider. If your domain name is registered from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\), see the related domain name documentations.

Alibaba Cloud International \(alibabacloud.com\) is an international registrar, so domain names registered from Alibaba Cloud International cannot be used for ICP Filing. Domain names registered from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\) can be ICP filed.

## How do I apply for an ICP Filing when multiple domain names direct to the same website? {#section_pq2_xls_zdb .section}

If you have multiple domain names that direct to the same websites, you only have to enter one of the domain names on the ICP Filing type verification page. To add other domain names, click **Add other Domain Names** on the website information page \(only available in Chinese\).

 Different provinces/municipalities have different rules for domain name ICP Filing. Guangxi Communications Administration and Chongqing Communications Administration allow only one domain name to be filed for one website. Other communications administrations allow 10 domain names to be filed for a website in one ICP Filing application.

If multiple domain names direct to different websites, you must finish the information of one website, and then click **Save, and Add Another Website**.

## Do I have to apply for ICP Filing for second-level domain names? {#section_sq2_xls_zdb .section}

You must apply for ICP Filing from the MIIT for domain names that direct to websites hosted on servers in mainland China. After a top-level domain name is ICP filed, its second-level domain names and other sub-domain names can direct to a server in mainland China. You are not  required to apply for ICP Filing for these domain names.

-   If the ICP Filing number of your top-level domain name is not obtained through Alibaba Cloud, you must transfer the ICP Filing information of the top-level domain name to Alibaba Cloud \(a top-level domain name can have multiple transfer providers\). see [Transfer an ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud.md#).
-   According to MIIT regulations, you cannot provide website access using top-level domain names that have not obtained ICP Filing numbers. If a top-level domain name has no ICP Filing number, you must submit an ICP Filing application for this domain name. After the application is approved, its second-level domain names and other sub-domain names can be accessed normally. For more information about the initial ICP Filing process, see [Guide for ICP Filing process](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/ICP Filing for the first time.md#).

## Can I apply for ICP Filing for country-specific domain names and domain names registered outside mainland China? {#section_uq2_xls_zdb .section}

No. Only domain names registered in mainland China can be ICP filed with the MIIT.

## How to obtain a domain name certificate? {#section_vq2_xls_zdb .section}

Currently, some communications administrations require you to provide domain name certificates when applying for a domain name ICP Filing. For enterprise ICP Filings, the domain name certificates must be stamped with the company seal.

For domain names registered in mainland China, contact your domain name registrar to download domain name certificates. If you use a domain name registered from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\), log on to the Domain Name console, click **Manage**. On the Basic Information page, click **Download Domain Name Certificate** and you can download your certificates on the page.

## The domain name I recently purchased already has an MIIT ICP Filing number. What can I do? {#section_wq2_xls_zdb .section}

If the domain name you purchased already has ICP Filing information at the MIIT and this information is not yours, this may be because another user previously registered the domain name and obtained an ICP Filing. Go to the Public Query page of the MIIT ICP Filing management system\(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\) to query your domain name information. Then, go to the website of the corresponding provincial/municipal communications administration to download the ICP Filing Cancellation Application Form, and cancel the ICP Filing information of the domain name according to the instructions. After you cancel the record, you can reapply for an ICP Filing for this domain name.

## The system prompts that my domain name is not supported by the ICP Filing system. What can I do? {#section_yq2_xls_zdb .section}

Not all domain names are eligible for ICP Filing. ICP Filing is only provided for domain name indexed by the MIIT. Domain names not approved by the MIIT cannot be used for ICP Filing.

Go to the [MIIT website](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146285/n1146352/n3054355/n3057709/n3057722/c4416816/content.html)  to query the domain name extensions supported by ICP Filing. If the domain name you purchased is not supported by the ICP Filing system, you can direct it to a server outside the mainland China. ICP Filings are not required for websites hosted on servers outside mainland China.

## When I submit an application, the system prompts that the subject information for this domain name already exists. What can I do? {#section_zq2_xls_zdb .section}

At the time of application submission on the ICP Filing system, if the system prompts "Subject information for this domain name already exists in the system. Log on with your account and transfer the ICP Filing", you must log on with the account that you used to submit the previous application to finish the ICP Filing.
