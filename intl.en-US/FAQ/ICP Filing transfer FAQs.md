## Do I have to transfer the original ICP Filing to Alibaba Cloud? {#section_jsm_c3t_zdb .section}

Currently, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) requires that ICP Filing data be recorded by the website hosting service provider. Therefore, if you change the website hosting service provider, you must apply to transfer your ICP Filing to the new service provider. Otherwise, access to your website is affected and even your ICP Filing number may be deregistered. Therefore, you must transfer your ICP Filing. For more information, see [Transfer an ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud.md#).

## What is the difference between Add New Website for ICP Filing and New ICP Filing Transfer? {#section_ksm_c3t_zdb .section}

If you have already successfully obtained an ICP number through Alibaba Cloud for a website, the **Add New Website for ICP Filing** and **New ICP Filing Transfer** buttons are both displayed when you log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

-   Add New Website for ICP Filing: Use this button to add a new website without an ICP number for ICP Filing.

-   New ICP Filing Transfer: If you have obtained an ICP number for your website from another service provider and want to host the website on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance, you must transfer your ICP Filing information from that service provider to Alibaba Cloud.


## Can I change the subject or website information during the ICP Filing transfer? {#section_msm_c3t_zdb .section}

The ICP Filing transfer process only adds a new service provider to your ICP Filing information. Therefore, during the transfer process, you cannot modify the ICP Filing information. You can modify the information at the original service provider before transfer, or submit an information change application in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system after transfer.  The rules for ICP Filing transfer vary across different local communications administrations. See the [Rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) of communications administrations.

## Is my website accessible if my ICP Filing transfer application is rejected? {#section_nsm_c3t_zdb .section}

During the transfer process, if the ICP Filing information for your domain name has not been cancelled, the approval status of your ICP Filing transfer application does not affect the accessibility to your website. If your application is rejected, log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system immediately, to view the reasons for rejection, make the necessary changes, and resubmit your application. If you have not transferred your ICP Filing for a long period of time and you have no other website hosting service provider, your ICP number may be cancelled by the communications administration.

## Do I have to update the ICP Filing information after the transfer? {#section_osm_c3t_zdb .section}

After successfully transferring your ICP Filing to Alibaba Cloud, you receive a message about the review result from the communications administration. Any changes to your registration information \(such as the website name, website administrator, subject name, and subject type\) must be updated. Otherwise, the ICP number can be at the risk of being cancelled.

## Will my website be accessible if I cancel the transfer? {#section_psm_c3t_zdb .section}

Canceling the transfer disassociates your ICP Filing information from Alibaba Cloud. Therefore, your domain name cannot direct to an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance.  However, your ICP Filing number is still valid, so contact the website hosting service provider you are currently using and submit a transfer application immediately to avoid disruptions in accessing to your website.

## What is the difference between canceling the transfer and canceling an ICP Filing number? {#section_qsm_c3t_zdb .section}

Cancel ICP Filing transfer: Alibaba Cloud no longer serves as your service provider and the domain name cannot direct to an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance. However, your ICP Filing number is valid. In this case, contact your existing website hosting service provider and submit a transfer application immediately.

Cancel an ICP Filing Number: This operation cancels your ICP Filing number from the MIIT. Once the ICP Filing number is cancelled, your website cannot be open for public visit.

Orders of ICP Filing cancellation cannot be deleted, so perform ICP Filing cancellation after you make sure you want to cancel the ICP Filing.
