# Domain name information verification {#concept_blm_wrl_zdb .concept}

The domain name must meet all the requirements of the MIIT.

The MIIT announcement  can be viewed at: [http://www.miit.gov.cn/newweb/n1146285/n1146352/n3054355/n3057709/n3057714/c5930543/content.html](http://www.miit.gov.cn/newweb/n1146285/n1146352/n3054355/n3057709/n3057714/c5930543/content.html) .

To further regulate the use of domain names by Internet information service providers, according to the laws and regulations: Counter-terrorism Law of the People’s Republic of China, Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, Regulation on Internet Information Service of the People’s Republic of China, and Measures for the Administration of Internet Domain Names, domain names used for Internet information must be registered in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations effective from January 1, 2018. Specifically, the domain name registrant of an individual ICP Filing must be the ICP Filing subject, and the domain name registrant of an enterprise ICP Filing must be the enterprise, the primary enterprise owner, or the legal representative.

When your ICP Filing information is submitted to the competent communications administration for review, the domain name information is verified. If the domain name information verification fails, the ICP Filing fails. In addition, Alibaba Cloud regularly checks the status of the domain names used by Internet information service providers. If nonexistent domain names, expired domain names, domain names without owner information, and other such problems are found, ICP Filing services for such domain names will be stopped in accordance with the requirements of the relevant communication authorities. To guarantee that your website domain name can be filed successfully, make sure the required information is complete.
